I have been using [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr) for a while and found it changing my codes in R scripts. It is very convenient as for data mungling and cleaning (whatever the verb you wish to use). The main syntax '%>%' is almost like '|' in linux, any data frame can be passed/piped into the next verb.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
data(DNase)

head(DNase)
summary(DNase)

dat <- DNase %>% 
	filter(Run != 10) %>%   # filtering any Run smaller than 10
  	tbl_df()

summary(dat)

dat <- DNase %>%
	mutate(Run_duplicate = Run) # make a new column with the verb 'mutate'

head(dat)

summaryTable <- dat %>% 
              group_by(Run) %>% 
              summarize(number_of_sample = n(),        # group_by and summarize can be very useful for
                        sum_density = sum(density))    # getting summary statistics for different categories	

summaryTable
```
