These is a function that I recursively used in analysis using R. I have rewritten in *Rcpp* to make use of vectorization and make the task faster.

### Benchmarking
The function takes in a numeric vector and make all the NA values into 0, which is handy when there's missing data in the table.

I will test the speed compare to the original **ifelse** R equivalent command.

```{r warning=FALSE ,message=FALSE}
library(Rcpp)
library(microbenchmark)

#load/compile the functions
sourceCpp('~/scripts/R/Rcpp/Rfunctions.cpp')

#simulate data
a <- sample(c(rnorm(100000,1:100),rep(NA,10000)))

#test second function
microbenchmark(removeNA(a),ifelse(is.na(a),0,a))
```

From the experiment, *Rcpp* functions make use of vectorization and increase the speed significantly (did not do a t-test, but probably p<0.05).
